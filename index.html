                      In this project, I had to write a program in Java to navigate a robot through a randomly generated maze. The robot needed to avoid crashing into walls and pick the correct route to move towards the target.
                      <br>
                      In the event multiple moves made the robot move towards the target, a random move was chosen.

                      This task built on Maze 1 and required the robot to carry out a depth-first search in order to find the target. I used a stack to allow the robot to efficiently backtrack and find a correct route. After the depth-first search, the robot is able to use the stack to navigate a clear route to the target.
                      <br>
                      As an additional feature, I created a program which allowed the user to control the robot using a keyboard.

                      In this project, I created the familiar game Tic TacToe in Android Studio using Java. The app allows two users to play the game, alert the winner of the game, keep score of the game and allows the game to be reset. As my first project using Android Studio, this task was mainly to improve my basic Java skills and produce a Android APK.

                      During the Summer, I took part in a Nuffield Foundation Research Placement, where I had to program a
                      Robot Arm to carry out various movements in Python and designed an interactive set of tasks for
                      younger students to learn about programming using this Robot Arm. Furthermore, I had to plan,
                      prepare and deliver a presentation and report about my research project to a selection of Computer
                      Science experts, which further developed my communication skills and self-confidence. I received
                      the Gold CREST Award for my research into Robotics. (Blog Posts <a href="http://robotsandphysicalcomputing.blogspot.com/2017/08/how-to-use-ps3-controller-to-move-usb.html">1</a>

                      This project simulated the basic functionality of Twitter and involved storing and retrieving users, ‘Weets’, and followers. Hash tables and adjacency matrices were used to store and retrieve the data, ensuring a fast and efficient process.

                      In this project, I created the familiar game Tic TacToe in Android Studio using Java. The app allows two users to play the game, alert the winner of the game, keep score of the game and allows the game to be reset. As my first project using Android Studio, this task was mainly to improve my basic Java skills and produce a Android APK.

                      <br>
                      During the Summer, I took part in a Nuffield Foundation Research Placement, where I had to program a
                      Robot Arm to carry out various movements in Python and designed an interactive set of tasks for
                      younger students to learn about programming using this Robot Arm. Furthermore, I had to plan,
                      prepare and deliver a presentation and report about my research project to a selection of Computer
                      Science experts, which further developed my communication skills and self-confidence. I received
                      the Gold CREST Award for my research into Robotics. (Blog Posts <a href="http://robotsandphysicalcomputing.blogspot.com/2017/08/how-to-use-ps3-controller-to-move-usb.html">1</a>

                      In this group project <strong>(Sponsored by Deutsche Bank)</strong>, we were tasked with creating a derivative trade reporting and analytical tool. Our project was able to add, edit and delete derivate trade and currency data, in additon to using Machine Learning to find ‘fat-finger’ errors and other inconsistencies in the data over time. For this project, we used Python with the Flask Web framework along in combination with isolation forest used in the machine learning.

                    <br>
                      In this project, I created a Timetable Scheduler which will schedule a given a set of modules and lab sessions on weekdays with a given number of slots, ensuring the sessions are scheduled in the most cost-effective way. This is an example of a solution to a constraint satisfaction problem and uses backtracking in addition to a MRV ordering heuristic to find the best solution.

                      In this task, I created a Packet sniffer that can detect and analyse Ethernet, ARP, IPv4 and TCP packets written in C. In addition, the program can also detect intrusions such as: SYN attacks, ARP poisoning and blacklisted URLs. Packets are analysed concurrently using a thread pool with a maximum of 10 threads.

                    <br>
                      In this task, I created a database system for a department store that stores the inventory, orders, collections, deliveries and staff. Using JDBC, the system allows staff to create in-store purchases, collections and deliveries, review the biggest selling products, calculate staff life-time success, staff contribution and candidates for employee of the year all using SQL queries. Input is carefully sanitised and validated before the SQL query is constructed.
